# Online Job Bank DBMS

## Overview
This repository contains an **Online Job Bank Database Management System** developed using **Java** and **SQL**. The system models the backend of a job recruitment platform, enabling interaction between job applicants, recruiters, and companies. Core functionalities include job postings, job applications, resume management, interview scheduling, and application status tracking.

The backend is implemented using a **BCNF-normalized relational database**, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and minimal redundancy. The frontend consists of a **Java-based graphical user interface (GUI)** that allows users to interact with the database intuitively. This project was developed as part of a **Relational Database Systems** course and demonstrates key database concepts such as entity-relationship modeling, schema design, functional dependencies, normalization (3NF and BCNF), SQL querying, and relational algebra.

A detailed project report accompanies the implementation, outlining the system’s conceptual design, logical schema, normalization process, SQL implementation, supported queries, user guide, and relational algebra for the queries.
